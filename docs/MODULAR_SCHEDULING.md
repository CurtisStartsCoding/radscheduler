# Modular Scheduling System

RadScheduler provides a **dual scheduling system** that can be configured to work with any RIS (Radiology Information System) while allowing patients to self-schedule when appropriate.

## üéØ Overview

The system supports two scheduling workflows:

1. **RIS Integration**: Pull appointments from your existing RIS (Avreo, Epic, Cerner, etc.)
2. **Patient Self-Scheduling**: Allow patients to book appointments directly through RadScheduler

Both workflows are **modular and configurable** - you can enable/disable features based on your RIS type and hospital policies.

## üîß Configuration Options

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `ENABLE_PATIENT_SCHEDULING` | Enable patient self-scheduling globally | `false` | `true` |
| `RIS_TYPE` | Type of RIS system | `avreo` | `epic`, `cerner`, `custom` |
| `ALLOWED_MODALITIES` | Modalities patients can self-schedule | `X-Ray,Ultrasound` | `X-Ray,Ultrasound,Mammography` |
| `RESTRICTED_MODALITIES` | Modalities requiring approval | `MRI,CT` | `MRI,CT,Angiography` |

### RIS-Specific Configurations

#### Avreo RIS (Recommended)
```bash
export ENABLE_PATIENT_SCHEDULING=true
export RIS_TYPE=avreo
```
- ‚úÖ Self-scheduling enabled for: X-Ray, Ultrasound, Mammography
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires approval for: MRI, CT
- üîÑ Syncs every 5 minutes

#### Epic RIS
```bash
export ENABLE_PATIENT_SCHEDULING=true
export RIS_TYPE=epic
```
- ‚ùå Self-scheduling disabled (Epic handles scheduling)
- üîÑ Syncs appointments from Epic every 10 minutes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All modalities require approval

#### Cerner RIS
```bash
export ENABLE_PATIENT_SCHEDULING=true
export RIS_TYPE=cerner
```
- ‚ùå Self-scheduling disabled (Cerner handles scheduling)
- üîÑ Syncs appointments from Cerner every 15 minutes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è All modalities require approval

#### Custom RIS
```bash
export ENABLE_PATIENT_SCHEDULING=true
export RIS_TYPE=custom
export CUSTOM_SELF_SCHEDULING=true
export CUSTOM_ALLOWED_MODALITIES=X-Ray,Ultrasound
export CUSTOM_REQUIRES_APPROVAL=MRI,CT
export CUSTOM_SYNC_ENABLED=true
export CUSTOM_SYNC_INTERVAL=5
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Enable Patient Self-Scheduling

```bash
# For Avreo RIS
export ENABLE_PATIENT_SCHEDULING=true
export RIS_TYPE=avreo

# Restart the API server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Access Patient Scheduling

- **Web Interface**: `http://localhost:3000/patient-schedule`
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - `GET /api/patient/available-slots`
  - `POST /api/patient/book-appointment`
  - `GET /api/patient/my-appointments`
  - `POST /api/patient/cancel-appointment`

### 3. Configure Avreo Integration

```bash
export AVREO_API_URL=https://your-avreo-instance.com/api
export AVREO_USERNAME=your_username
export AVREO_PASSWORD=your_password
```

## üîÑ Dual Scheduling Workflow

### 1. RIS Integration
- Pulls appointments from your RIS calendar API
- Syncs every 5-15 minutes (configurable)
- Maintains appointment history and status
- Handles cancellations and updates

### 2. Patient Self-Scheduling
- Patients book appointments through web interface
- Real-time availability checking
- Conflict detection with existing appointments
- Automatic SMS confirmations
- Approval workflow for complex procedures

### 3. Unified Management
- All appointments in one system
- AI-powered conflict detection
- SMS notifications for all appointments
- Complete audit trail
- Role-based access control

## üìä Benefits

### For Hospitals
- **Reduce Phone Calls**: Patients can self-schedule 24/7
- **Improve Efficiency**: Automated scheduling and notifications
- **Maintain Control**: Approval workflow for complex procedures
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing RIS systems
- **HIPAA Compliant**: Full audit trail and security

### For Patients
- **24/7 Booking**: Schedule appointments anytime
- **Real-time Availability**: See available slots instantly
- **Instant Confirmation**: SMS notifications
- **Easy Management**: View and cancel appointments online
- **No Phone Calls**: Self-service reduces wait times

## üîí Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance
- All patient data encrypted in transit and at rest
- Complete audit trail for all actions
- Role-based access control
- Secure API authentication

### Approval Workflow

- Pending appointments clearly marked
- Staff can approve/reject with comments
- Automatic notifications to patients

### Data Protection
- Patient data never stored in plain text
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Regular security audits
- Compliance with healthcare regulations
