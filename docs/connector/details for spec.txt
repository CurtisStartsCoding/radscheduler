I'll create a simple, elegant HL7 integration specification that you can implement without over-engineering.I've created a complete but simple HL7 integration specification for you. Key points:

**What makes it simple:**
- Only 2 message types (orders and documents)
- Standard libraries, no custom protocol handling
- Single service handles all clients
- Configuration-driven per client

**Time to build:** 3-4 weeks for a solid implementation

**Per-client overhead:** 2-4 hours typically

**Critical success factors:**
1. Use a message queue (prevents lost messages)
2. Use existing HL7 libraries (don't parse manually)
3. Keep configurations in a database (not hardcoded)
4. Log everything (debugging is 90% of integration work)

The spec includes actual code examples you can start with, not just theory. Most importantly, it's designed to handle 50+ radiology groups without becoming a maintenance nightmare.

Want me to dive deeper into any specific component, like the MLLP connection handling or the message builder logic?
