## ⚠️ What to Watch Out For

### Old Docs Are Deleted
All obsolete documentation has been permanently removed from the working directory. Old docs are only accessible via git history if needed for reference.

### Source of Truth Documents
Always refer to these for Phase 5.2:

1. **`radscheduler-hardening-plan.md`** - Architecture and security plan
2. **`README.md`** (new) - Main project documentation
3. **`docs/README.md`** (new) - Documentation index
4. **`../radorderpad-api/final-documentation/qvera/phase-5.2-radscheduler-sms-epic.md`** - Complete spec

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

After cleanup, the following are true:

✅ **All documentation describes SMS scheduling ONLY**
✅ **No mention of direct RIS integration** (only QIE middleware)
✅ **No mention of AI/Claude/Anthropic**
✅ **No mention of Redis** (PostgreSQL only)
✅ **No mention of HL7 processing** in RadScheduler
✅ **All docs mention QIE as middleware**
✅ **All docs mention HIPAA compliance** (hashing, consent, audit)
✅ **Environment variables match Phase 5.2 requirements**
✅ **Old docs deleted** (preserved in git history)

## 📊 Statistics

### Documentation Reduction
- **Before:** 15+ active documentation files
- **After:** 4 new Phase 5.2 files (11 deleted)
- **Reduction:** ~73% fewer files, 100% clarity

### Environment Variables
- **Before:** 12+ variables (many unused)
- **After:** 8 required variables + 3 optional
- **Removed:** REDIS_URL, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, AVREO_*, DEMO_*

### Architecture Clarity
- **Before:** Mixed messages (AI + SMS + HL7 + direct RIS)
- **After:** Single purpose (SMS scheduling via QIE middleware)
- **Improvement:** 100% clarity on Phase 5.2 goals

## 🔄 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Implement Phase 5.2 features** per hardening plan
2. ⚠️ **Update production checklist** for SMS-only deployment
3. ⚠️ **Create SMS conversation flow docs** (optional but helpful)
4. ⚠️ **Update PRD** for Phase 5.2 scope
5. ✅ **Refer to archived docs only for historical reference**

## 📞 Questions?

- **Where is the old documentation?** → Deleted (preserved in git history at `backup-voice-ai-sept21`)
- **What if I need to reference old architecture?** → Use `git show backup-voice-ai-sept21:README.md` or checkout that branch
- **Why not keep an archive?** → Git IS the archive. No need for duplicate files.
- **What if new devs see old docs?** → They can't - only Phase 5.2 docs exist now

---

**Cleanup completed successfully.** Documentation now accurately reflects Phase 5.2 SMS scheduling architecture.
